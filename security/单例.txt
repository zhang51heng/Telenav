Hi Team,
 
As part of our commitment to partners, we are required to take Security Awareness training on an annual basis – please finalize your training by end of February 2018.
Given the issues we had in this domain I want to highlight that we need to take this really seriously (and I think it’s also a valuable skill for all of us to enhance, so I hope you enjoy that).
 
Please note that this is mandatory, and I asked Gary to brief me on completion of those courses and we will follow-up with everybody who has not.
